Prediction for SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing

Description:

In this case study, we will forecast whether the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website for 62 million dollars; other providers charge up to 165 million dollars each; much of the savings is due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. As a result, if we can predict whether the first stage will land, we can estimate the cost of a launch. This data can be used if another company wants to compete with SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this lab, you will collect data from an API and ensure that it is in the correct format. The example below is of a successful

The majority of failed landings are planned. Space X makes a safe landing in the oceans.
